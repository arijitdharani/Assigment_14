<p class="story">This is where you shift focus away from the restaurant <br>
     and back to the guest. It’s time for you to share what you <br>
    provide your customers that no one else does.</p> <br>

   <h2 class="heading01"> What are you all about? </h2> <br>
    <p class="story"> What are your company values, and how do they differentiate you  <br>
     from other restaurants? <br>
    
    The About Us page for one of my favorite restaurants in Austin, <br>
    Emmer & Rye, does a nice job with this. <br>
     They highlight their focus on heirloom grains, <br> 
     whole animal butchery, and in-house fermentation. <br>
     They also briefly explain what to expect when you dine with <br> 
     them—small plates to share, as well as the dim sum carts that <br>
      circulate the restaurant.</p>
